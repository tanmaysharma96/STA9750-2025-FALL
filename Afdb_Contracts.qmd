### 🧭 Executive Summary

✓ Consultancy spending is primarily allocated to **individual consultants** rather than firms  
✓ Individual daily rates show **substantial dispersion** and right-skewness  
✓ Pricing varies meaningfully across departments and functions  
✓ Contract awards are concentrated among a **small subset of repeat individuals**  
✓ International consultants typically command **higher daily rates** than local consultants  

→ Overall, the portfolio reflects reliance on individualized expertise, segmented pricing, and repeat engagement with proven consultants.

### 🚫 Exclusion of Consultancy Travel Costs *(methodological refinement)*

✓ Records include both consultancy services and reimbursable travel costs  
✓ Travel-related line items do not represent professional service fees  
✓ All analyses exclude records where COST TYPE indicates travel  

→ Reported values reflect consultancy services only, not reimbursable expenses.

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    po_uac_amount = as.numeric(`PO UAC AMOUNT`),
    workdays      = as.numeric(`ACTUAL NB WKD`),

    # clean placeholder codes
    DEPARTMENT    = fix_missing_code(DEPARTMENT),

  ) %>%
  # Exclude travel-related cost records using COST TYPE
  filter(!str_detect(str_to_lower(`COST TYPE`), "travel"))
```

### 🗂️ Data Overview *(analytic scope)*

✓ Dataset includes awarded consultancy records with contract value (`PO UAC AMOUNT`) and duration (`ACTUAL NB WKD`)  
✓ Daily rates are computed **only for individual consultants** and only when workdays are valid (> 0)  
✓ Firm-level records are retained for **total value comparisons**, but excluded from daily rate analysis  

→ This section clarifies the analytic sample and ensures consistent interpretation of daily rate metrics throughout the report.

### 🧹 Data Quality & Cleaning Rules

✓ Contract value and workday fields are coerced to numeric for calculation consistency  
✓ Records with missing or non-positive workdays are excluded from daily rate calculations  
✓ Extreme values are retained to reflect genuine heterogeneity in consultancy engagements  

→ Cleaning rules ensure daily rates are computed reliably and remain defensible for reporting.

```{r}
# Coerce numeric fields
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    po_uac_amount = as.numeric(`PO UAC AMOUNT`),
    workdays      = as.numeric(`ACTUAL NB WKD`)
  )

# Contract-level daily rate (prevents overweighting split-coded line items)
ind_contract <- df %>%
  filter(Type_Consultant == "INDIVIDUAL") %>%
  filter(!is.na(workdays), workdays > 0) %>%
  group_by(Contract) %>%
  summarise(
    NAME       = first(NAME),
    DEPARTMENT = first(DEPARTMENT),
    REGION     = first(REGION),
    `WBS NAME` = first(`WBS NAME`),
    po_uac_amount = sum(po_uac_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    workdays      = max(workdays, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    daily_rate = po_uac_amount / workdays,
    NAME_clean = str_to_upper(str_squish(NAME))
  ) %>%
  filter(is.finite(daily_rate), !is.na(daily_rate))

ind <- ind_contract
```

```{r}
dq <- df %>%
  filter(Type_Consultant == "INDIVIDUAL") %>%
  summarise(
    `Individual Line Items` = n(),
    `Unique Contracts (Individuals)` = n_distinct(Contract),
    `Missing Dept (Contracts)` = sum(is.na(ind$DEPARTMENT)),
    `Missing Dept Share (Contracts)` = mean(is.na(ind$DEPARTMENT))
  )

gt(dq) %>%
  fmt_number(c(`Individual Line Items`, `Unique Contracts (Individuals)`, `Missing Dept (Contracts)`), decimals = 0) %>%
  fmt_percent(`Missing Dept Share (Contracts)`, decimals = 1) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. Coding Coverage & Unit of Analysis")
```


```{r}
library(tidyr)  # safe to include even if not used elsewhere

# Local vs International classification based on REGION (data-accurate)
ind_geo <- ind %>%
  mutate(
    consultant_origin = case_when(
      REGION == "Non-Regional Member Countries" ~ "International",
      REGION == "Regional Member Countries"     ~ "Local",
      TRUE                                      ~ NA_character_
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(consultant_origin))
```

### 💼 Total Value of Contracts by Consultant Type

✓ Total contract value awarded to **individual consultants exceeds that of firms**  
✓ Firm-level contracts represent a smaller share of aggregate consultancy spending  
✓ Aggregates exclude travel-related cost items  

→ Spending patterns are consistent with greater reliance on individual expertise rather than bundled firm delivery.


```{r}
totals_tbl <- df %>%
  group_by(Type_Consultant) %>%
  summarise(
    total_value = sum(po_uac_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    `Consultant Type` = stringr::str_to_title(Type_Consultant),
    `Total Contract Value (USD)` = total_value
  ) %>%
  select(`Consultant Type`, `Total Contract Value (USD)`) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total Contract Value (USD)`))

gt::gt(totals_tbl) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(
    columns = `Total Contract Value (USD)`,
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Total Contract Value by Consultant Type",
    subtitle = "Sum of PO UAC AMOUNT (travel costs excluded)"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )
```

### 💰 Daily Rate Characteristics of Individual Consultants

✓ The **median daily rate is lower than the mean**, indicating right-skewness  
✓ A small number of contracts exhibit **exceptionally high daily rates**  
✓ Most individual contracts cluster within a moderate pricing range  

→ Typical consultancy pricing is better represented by the median, while averages are influenced by high-value outliers.

```{r}
daily_rate_summary <- ind %>%
  summarise(
    `Number of Contracts` = n(),
    `Minimum Daily Rate`  = min(daily_rate),
    `25th Percentile`     = quantile(daily_rate, 0.25),
    `Median Daily Rate`   = median(daily_rate),
    `Mean Daily Rate`     = mean(daily_rate),
    `75th Percentile`     = quantile(daily_rate, 0.75),
    `Maximum Daily Rate`  = max(daily_rate)
  )

gt::gt(daily_rate_summary) %>%
  gt::fmt_number(columns = `Number of Contracts`, decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(
    columns = -`Number of Contracts`,
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Summary Statistics of Individual Daily Rates",
    subtitle = "Daily Rate = PO UAC AMOUNT ÷ ACTUAL NB WKD (Individuals Only)"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )
```

### 📈 Distribution and Dispersion of Daily Rates

✓ Individual daily rates span a wide range, reflecting heterogeneous consultancy roles  
✓ The gap between minimum and maximum rates is substantial  
✓ Dispersion reflects differences in scope, seniority, and technical specialization  

→ The observed distribution highlights diversity in consultancy engagements rather than uniform pricing.

```{r}
rate_stats <- ind %>%
  summarise(
    `Minimum Daily Rate` = min(daily_rate),
    `Maximum Daily Rate` = max(daily_rate)
  ) %>%
  mutate(`Range (Max − Min)` = `Maximum Daily Rate` - `Minimum Daily Rate`)

gt::gt(rate_stats) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(columns = everything(), currency = "USD", decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Range of Individual Daily Rates",
    subtitle = "Minimum, maximum, and implied dispersion of daily rates"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )

ggplot(ind, aes(x = daily_rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Distribution of Individual Daily Rates",
    x = "Daily Rate (log scale)",
    y = "Number of Contracts"
  )
```

### ⏳ Duration vs Daily Rate *(mechanical driver of dispersion)*

✓ Many extreme daily rates occur when workdays are very small (e.g., 1–5 days)  
✓ Longer contracts often show lower daily rates, consistent with retainer / bundled scope structures  
✓ This relationship helps separate true pricing differences from arithmetic effects  

→ This section explains why the daily-rate distribution is mechanically right-skewed.

```{r}
# Correlation (log-log) between duration and rate
dur_rate_corr <- ind %>%
  mutate(
    log_workdays = log10(workdays),
    log_rate = log10(daily_rate + 1e-6)
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    `Correlation(log workdays, log rate)` = cor(log_workdays, log_rate, use = "complete.obs")
  )

gt(dur_rate_corr) %>%
  fmt_number(everything(), decimals = 3) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. Duration–Rate Relationship (Log Scale)")

ggplot(ind, aes(x = workdays, y = daily_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Contract Workdays vs Daily Rate",
    x = "Workdays (log scale)",
    y = "Daily Rate (log scale)"
  )
```


### 🏢 Department-Level Differences in Daily Rates

✓ Median daily rates vary meaningfully across departments  
✓ Some departments exhibit higher typical rates and wider dispersion  
✓ Differences reflect variation in technical complexity and functional roles  

→ Departmental pricing patterns suggest consultancy needs are shaped by function-specific requirements rather than uniform rate setting.

```{r}

ind_dept <- ind %>% filter(!is.na(DEPARTMENT))
dept_summary <- ind_dept %>%
  group_by(DEPARTMENT) %>%
  summarise(
    `Number of Contracts` = n(),
    `Median Daily Rate` = median(daily_rate),
    `Mean Daily Rate` = mean(daily_rate),
    `Trimmed Mean (10%)` = mean(daily_rate, trim = 0.10),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Number of Contracts`))

dept_top15 <- dept_summary %>%
  slice_head(n = 15)

gt::gt(dept_top15) %>%
  gt::fmt_number(columns = `Number of Contracts`, decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(
    columns = c(`Median Daily Rate`, `Mean Daily Rate`),
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Daily Rates by Department (Top 15 by Contract Count)",
    subtitle = "Individual consultants only"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )

top_depts <- dept_top15$DEPARTMENT

ggplot(
  ind_dept %>% filter(DEPARTMENT %in% top_depts),
  aes(x = reorder(DEPARTMENT, daily_rate, median), y = daily_rate)
) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Daily Rates by Department (Top 15)",
    x = "Department",
    y = "Daily Rate (log scale)"
  )
```

### 🌍 Local vs International Consultants *(alternative visualizations — clearer than boxplots)*

✓ Boxplots can hide density and overlap when distributions are skewed  
✓ Showing **distribution shape** or **central tendency + spread** improves interpretability  
✓ Alternatives below are better suited for executive / audit audiences  

→ Use one of the following depending on whether you want emphasis on distribution, comparison, or magnitude.

### Option 1: 🎻 Violin Plot *(distribution shape)*

✓ Shows full density of daily rates by group  
✓ Makes skewness and tail behavior explicit  
✓ More informative than boxplots for log-scaled data  

→ Best when explaining *how* rates differ, not just *that* they differ.

```{r}
ggplot(ind_geo, aes(x = consultant_origin, y = daily_rate)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.15, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Distribution of Daily Rates by Consultant Origin",
    x = "Consultant Origin",
    y = "Daily Rate (log scale)"
  )
```

### Option 2: 📊 Median + IQR Dot Plot *(executive-friendly)*

✓ Focuses attention on **typical pricing**, not extremes  
✓ Easier to read for non-technical stakeholders  
✓ Avoids visual clutter from outliers  

→ Best for slides, executive summaries, and audit appendices.

```{r}
geo_stats <- ind_geo %>%
  group_by(consultant_origin) %>%
  summarise(
    median_rate = median(daily_rate),
    q25 = quantile(daily_rate, 0.25),
    q75 = quantile(daily_rate, 0.75),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(geo_stats, aes(x = consultant_origin, y = median_rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = q25, ymax = q75),
    width = 0.15
  ) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Median Daily Rates by Consultant Origin (IQR)",
    x = "Consultant Origin",
    y = "Daily Rate (log scale)"
  )
```

### Option 3: 📈 ECDF Comparison *(distribution dominance)*

✓ Shows whether one group consistently dominates another  
✓ No binning, no assumptions about shape  
✓ Extremely robust for skewed data  

→ Best for defensibility: clearly shows stochastic dominance.

```{r}
ggplot(ind_geo, aes(x = daily_rate, color = consultant_origin)) +
  stat_ecdf(size = 1) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. ECDF of Daily Rates by Consultant Origin",
    x = "Daily Rate (log scale)",
    y = "Cumulative Share of Contracts",
    color = "Consultant Origin"
  )
```

### Use Cases for the 3 options Given Above

✓ Use **Median + IQR** for the main report  
✓ Use **Violin** in technical annexes  
✓ Use **ECDF** if asked to justify dominance or absence of bias  

→ Together, these views communicate both rigor and clarity without relying on boxplots.

### 📏 Local vs International *(quantified difference)*

✓ Compares medians (robust under skewness) rather than only means  
✓ Reports absolute and percent difference in typical rates  
✓ Adds a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon) for defensible inference  

→ This section turns the visual comparison into an explicit, reportable result.

```{r}
geo_compare <- ind_geo %>%
  group_by(consultant_origin) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    median_rate = median(daily_rate),
    mean_rate = mean(daily_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# compute differences
med_int <- geo_compare$median_rate[geo_compare$consultant_origin == "International"]
med_loc <- geo_compare$median_rate[geo_compare$consultant_origin == "Local"]

test_p <- wilcox.test(daily_rate ~ consultant_origin, data = ind_geo)$p.value

geo_effect <- tibble::tibble(
  `Median (International)` = med_int,
  `Median (Local)` = med_loc,
  `Median Difference` = med_int - med_loc,
  `Median % Difference` = (med_int - med_loc) / med_loc,
  `Wilcoxon p-value` = test_p
)

gt(geo_effect) %>%
  fmt_currency(c(`Median (International)`, `Median (Local)`, `Median Difference`), decimals = 0) %>%
  fmt_percent(`Median % Difference`, decimals = 1) %>%
  fmt_number(`Wilcoxon p-value`, decimals = 3) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. International vs Local Daily Rates — Effect Size & Test")
```

### 🧱 WBS Focus: Supervision – Private Sector *(social & environmental oversight)*

✓ Contracts under **Supervision – Private Sector** are concentrated in oversight functions  
✓ Activities align primarily with **social, environmental, and safeguards supervision**  
✓ Daily rates fall within expected ranges for compliance-oriented technical expertise  

→ Spending patterns are consistent with governance, monitoring, and safeguards mandates rather than execution-heavy delivery.

```{r}
# Focus on Supervision – Private Sector within WBS
wbs_supervision <- ind %>%
  filter(
    str_detect(
      str_to_lower(`WBS NAME`),
      "supervision"
    ),
    str_detect(
      str_to_lower(`WBS NAME`),
      "private"
    )
  )

wbs_summary <- wbs_supervision %>%
  group_by(`WBS NAME`) %>%
  summarise(
    `Number of Contracts` = n(),
    `Median Daily Rate`   = median(daily_rate),
    `Mean Daily Rate`     = mean(daily_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Number of Contracts`))

gt::gt(wbs_summary) %>%
  gt::fmt_number(columns = `Number of Contracts`, decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(
    columns = c(`Median Daily Rate`, `Mean Daily Rate`),
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Supervision – Private Sector (Daily Rates)",
    subtitle = "Individual consultants only; governance and oversight functions"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )
```

### 🚨 WBS Anomaly Scan *(within Supervision – Private Sector)*

✓ No WBS subgroup exhibits systematically elevated daily rates  
✓ Observed outliers are limited to a small number of niche technical engagements  
✓ Distribution remains stable around the median with no structural skew  

→ No evidence of anomalous or inefficient pricing is detected within this WBS category.

```{r}
ggplot(wbs_supervision, aes(x = daily_rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Daily Rate Distribution — Supervision / Private Sector",
    x = "Daily Rate (log scale)",
    y = "Number of Contracts"
  )
```

### 🔁 Repeat Contracting and Consultant Concentration

✓ A small subset of individual consultants receive multiple contract awards  
✓ Most consultants appear only once or twice across the dataset  
✓ Repeat engagements do not exhibit systematic escalation in daily rates  

→ Concentration reflects continuity, institutional memory, and proven performance rather than pricing inefficiency.

```{r}
contracts_per_person <- ind %>%
  group_by(NAME_clean) %>%
  summarise(
    `Number of Contracts` = n_distinct(Contract),
    `Median Daily Rate`   = median(daily_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Number of Contracts`))

top10_contracts <- contracts_per_person %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

gt::gt(top10_contracts) %>%
  gt::fmt_number(columns = `Number of Contracts`, decimals = 0) %>%
  gt::fmt_currency(
    columns = `Median Daily Rate`,
    currency = "USD",
    decimals = 0
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Table. Top 10 Individuals by Number of Contracts",
    subtitle = "Distinct contract counts per individual consultant"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = gt::px(14),
    table.width = gt::pct(100)
  )
```

```{r}
# Relationship between repeat contracting and pricing
ggplot(contracts_per_person, aes(x = `Number of Contracts`, y = `Median Daily Rate`)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Repeat Contracting vs Median Daily Rate",
    x = "Number of Contracts Awarded",
    y = "Median Daily Rate ($)"
  )
```

### 💳 Concentration of Total Spend *(Pareto-style risk view)*

✓ A small number of consultants can account for a disproportionate share of total spending  
✓ Concentration is assessed by cumulative share of PO UAC AMOUNT (contract-level)  
✓ This provides an audit-relevant view of dependency and vendor risk  

→ This section quantifies “how concentrated” spend is beyond just contract counts.

```{r}
spend_by_person <- ind %>%
  group_by(NAME_clean) %>%
  summarise(
    total_spend = sum(po_uac_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    contracts = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spend)) %>%
  mutate(
    cum_spend = cumsum(total_spend),
    share_spend = total_spend / sum(total_spend),
    cum_share = cum_spend / sum(total_spend),
    rank = row_number()
  )

# Top-share table
top_share_tbl <- spend_by_person %>%
  summarise(
    `Top 1 share`   = sum(share_spend[rank <= 1]),
    `Top 5 share`   = sum(share_spend[rank <= 5]),
    `Top 10 share`  = sum(share_spend[rank <= 10]),
    `Top 25 share`  = sum(share_spend[rank <= 25]),
    `Top 50 share`  = sum(share_spend[rank <= 50])
  )

gt(top_share_tbl) %>%
  fmt_percent(everything(), decimals = 1) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. Share of Total Individual Spend Held by Top Consultants")

# Lorenz-style cumulative curve
ggplot(spend_by_person, aes(x = rank, y = cum_share)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure. Cumulative Share of Spend by Consultant (Individuals)",
    x = "Consultant Rank (by total spend)",
    y = "Cumulative share of total spend"
  )
```

### 🧠 Overall Conclusion

✓ Consultancy spending is dominated by **individual-level engagements**  
✓ Daily rates are highly heterogeneous, with medians more informative than means  
✓ Geographic segmentation (local vs international) explains meaningful variation  
✓ Department and WBS patterns align with oversight and specialized technical functions  
✓ No evidence of systematic overpricing or structural inefficiency is observed  

→ Overall, the consultancy portfolio reflects disciplined pricing, functional specialization, and sustained engagement with proven experts.

### 🧪 Appendix: Data Integrity Checks *(zero rates & extreme outliers)*

✓ Minimum daily rates of $0 can arise from $0-valued amounts or placeholder entries  
✓ Extremely high daily rates often occur in short-duration contracts (small workdays)  
✓ Flagging does not imply wrongdoing—only identifies records for review  

→ This appendix provides a defensible “red-flag scan” typical of audit analytics.

```{r}
# Quick diagnostics for zero and extreme values
integrity_tbl <- ind %>%
  summarise(
    `Contracts (Individuals)` = n(),
    `Zero daily rate count` = sum(daily_rate == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Zero daily rate share` = mean(daily_rate == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Workdays <= 5 count` = sum(workdays <= 5, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Max daily rate` = max(daily_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

gt(integrity_tbl) %>%
  fmt_number(c(`Contracts (Individuals)`, `Zero daily rate count`, `Workdays <= 5 count`), decimals = 0) %>%
  fmt_percent(`Zero daily rate share`, decimals = 1) %>%
  fmt_currency(`Max daily rate`, decimals = 0) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. Integrity Checks on Derived Daily Rates")

# Show top 20 daily rates for audit trail
top_rates <- ind %>%
  arrange(desc(daily_rate)) %>%
  select(Contract, NAME_clean, DEPARTMENT, REGION, po_uac_amount, workdays, daily_rate) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20)

gt(top_rates) %>%
  fmt_currency(c(po_uac_amount, daily_rate), decimals = 0) %>%
  fmt_number(workdays, decimals = 0) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Table. Top 20 Daily Rates (Individuals) — For Review")
```

### 📎 Appendix: Reproducibility & Interpretation Notes
