### 📘 Overview  
This report analyzes how **subway ridership volume** and **transit-related crime** correlate across NYC’s transit system (2015–2025).  
This report makes use of **API-acquired open data**, monthly aggregation, robust data cleaning, correlation analysis, as well as visualizations in order to analyze time-varying crime–ridership dynamics.
:::

### 🚇 Specific Question (SQ): Does Subway Ridership Volume Correlate with Transit Crime?

✔ My SQ examines how both **monthly subway ridership** and **transit-related crime** move together  
✔ I use **NYPD Complaint Data** (filtered by subway incidents) as well as **MTA Monthly Ridership** from the years **2015–2025**  
✔ I evaluate if higher ridership corresponds to **higher crime counts** at a system-wide level  
✔ I also separates my analysis into **overall**, **pre-2022**, and **post-2022** time frames to accommodate for any COVID-era disruptions  
✔ Finally, I incorporate **correlation measures**, **indexed trends**, as well as **crimes per million riders** to capture both risk and volume performance  

➡ The overarching goal is to assess whether transit crime correlates with ridership volume, focusing on how this relationship may have changed in more recent years.

### 📦 Step 1: Loading Required Libraries

✔ **tidyverse** — this toolkit is responsible for visualization and transformation  
✔ **lubridate** — simplifies work related to time based grouping  
✔ **janitor** — cleans column names  
✔ **httr2** — handles API requests to download MTA and NYPD datasets  
✔ **readr** — efficient reading of large CSV files  
✔ **scales** — strengthens numeric formatting for plots such as labels and percentages

➡ These libraries provide the foundational tools for acquiring, cleaning, merging, and analyzing crime and ridership datasets.
```{r}
# ---- Loading Libraries ----
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(httr2)
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(gt)
```

### 📁 Step 2: Creating Project Data Directory

✔ This creates a dedicated folder (`data/courseproject`) to store datasets  
✔ Ensures a directory exists prior to saving files. This prevents any "write errors"  
✔ `recursive = TRUE` <- this allows creation of nested folders (if not already existing)  
✔ Helps to keep all raw data reproducible and organized across different machines

```{r}
dir.create(file.path("data", "courseproject"), showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
```
### 🚨 Step 3.1: Download Transit-Related NYPD Complaint Data (2015–2025)

✔ Obtains **only complaints related to subway** from NYC Open Data API  
✔ Applies a **date filter from 2015–2025** to avoid downloading irrelevant rows  
✔ Uses a **SELECT statement** to keep essential fields  
✔ Expands API limits, ensuring full and filtered dataset is returned  
✔ Saves cleaned CSV (locally) for quicker re-runs and reproducibility   

```{r}
# =========================================================
# 3.1 NYPD COMPLAINT DATA
# Only transit-related complaints, only 2015–2025
# =========================================================

complaints_req <- request("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/qgea-i56i.csv") |>
  req_url_query(
    "$select" = "cmplnt_num,cmplnt_fr_dt,juris_desc,prem_typ_desc,boro_nm,ofns_desc,law_cat_cd",
    "$where"  = "cmplnt_fr_dt between '2015-01-01T00:00:00' and '2025-12-31T23:59:59' AND (juris_desc = 'N.Y. TRANSIT POLICE' OR prem_typ_desc = 'TRANSIT - NYC SUBWAY')",
    "$limit"  = 500000
  )

complaints_path <- file.path("data", "courseproject", "complaints_transit_filtered.csv")

complaints_req |>
  req_progress() |>
  req_perform(path = complaints_path)

complaint_df <- readr::read_csv(
  complaints_path,
  show_col_types = FALSE
)
```
### 🚇 Step 3.2: Downloading MTA Monthly Subway Ridership Data

✔ Obtains **system-wide monthly ridership** for subways in NYC (2008–present)  
✔ Makes use of NY State Open Data archival API for stable downloading  
✔ Saves dataset to `data/courseproject/` for project structure that is consistent  
✔ `req_progress()` provides clear status of download when taking care of larger files  
✔ `read_csv()` loads data efficiently for merging as well as for pre-processing  

```{r}

# 3.2 MTA Monthly Ridership (Subway, 2008–Present)
url_data_monthly_ridership <- "https://data.ny.gov/api/archival.csv?id=xfre-bxip&version=64&method=export"

request(url_data_monthly_ridership) |>
req_progress() |>
req_perform(path = file.path("data", "courseproject", "monthly_ridership.csv"))

monthly_ridership_df <- read_csv(
file.path("data", "courseproject", "monthly_ridership.csv"),
show_col_types = FALSE
)
```
### 📅 Step 4: Defining a  Global Window Date (2015–2025)

✔ Sets a **10-year analysis window** for consistency amongst all datasets  
✔ Makes sure that ridership and crime data are the same on the monthly timeline  
✔ Deletes older records (pre-2015) as well as incomplete future records  
✔ Creates unified structure in order for accurate merging of NYPD and MTA  

➡ Creating this shared date range is important to produce valid comparisons
```{r}

# 4. Global Date Window for SQ (2015–2025)
start_date <- as.Date("2015-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2025-12-31")
```
### 🚨 Step 5: Building System-Wide Monthly Transit Crime Counts

✔ **Only subway-related incidents** are included after filtering NYPD complaint records   
✔ Takes each complaint as **single crime event** for aggregation on system-wide level   
✔ Converts complaint dates into **monthly units**, enabling time-aligned comparison with ridership
✔ Helps to ensures that only unique complaint numbers are counted in order to avoid duplication  
✔ Outputs crime totals (monthly) needed to evaluate the SQ  

➡ Creates the core dataset in order to analyze how transit crime levels fluctuate relative to subway ridership.
```{r}
# 5. Building Monthly Transit Crime Counts (System-Wide)
#SQ: Does subway ridership volume correlate with the number of crimes?
#Here we treat transit-related complaints as "crimes".
#ridership <- readr::read_csv(path_ridership, show_col_types = FALSE)
```
### 🚨 Filtering & Structuring Transit-Related Complaint Records

✔ Cleans column names for consistency across both datasets  
✔ Keeps only the complaints by **N.Y. Transit Police** or that occur in **NYC Subway premises**
✔ Converts raw complaint date into standard `Date` format  
✔ Converts dates to **monthly periods** using `floor_date()` to correlate with monthly ridership

➡ This process helps to isolate transit incidents, preparing them for correlation analysis on the monthly-level.

```{r}

complaints_transit <- complaint_df |>
clean_names() |>

filter(
juris_desc == "N.Y. TRANSIT POLICE" |
prem_typ_desc == "TRANSIT - NYC SUBWAY"
) |>
mutate(
date = as.Date(cmplnt_fr_dt),
month = floor_date(date, "month")
)
```
### 📅 Restricting Complaints to 2015–2025 Analysis Window

✔ This step removes complaints so that only incidents between **2015 and 2025** are included  
✔ Removes incomplete or outdated records that falls outside the range for analysis

➡ This helps ensure that the dataset is focused and pertains to the SQ.
```{r}
# =========================================================
# 🔗 4. restricting to our 2015–2025 window
# =========================================================
complaints_transit <- complaints_transit |>
filter(between(date, start_date, end_date))
```
### 🔍 Ensuring Unique Complaints & Building Monthly Crime Totals

✔ Uses `distinct()` in order to keep **only one record per complaint number**. This helps to prevent any accidental double-counting  
✔ Also groups the cleaned records by **month**, keeping in line with the structure of the ridership dataset  
✔ Counts total amount of **transit-related complaints** during each month  
✔ Produces a reliable and clean `felony_count` metric for analysis of crime 

```{r}
# =========================================================
# 📊 5. creating monthly transit crime counts
# =========================================================
complaints_transit <- complaints_transit |>
group_by(month) |>
summarise(
felony_count = n(), # total transit complaints per month
.groups = "drop"
)

summary(complaints_transit$felony_count)
head(complaints_transit)
```
### 🚇 Building Monthly System-Wide Subway Ridership

✔ This step standardizes names of columns for consistency  
✔ Detects **date column** and **total ridership column**  
✔ Using `floor_date()`, converts date values into periods on the monthly level   
✔ Helps ensure the ridership field is properly listed as a numeric value
✔ Filters the dataset to the **2015–2025** analysis window for our scope of study  
✔ Ridership at the **monthly level** is aggregated, producing a `subways_total` metric  

➡ This step creates a monthly ridership series essential in comparing against monthly crime counts.
```{r}
# =========================================================
# 📈 6. Building System Wide Monthly Subway Ridership
# =========================================================

monthly_ridership_df <- monthly_ridership_df |>
clean_names()

# ---- A) Trying to detect date and subway ridership columns ----
date_col_r <- names(monthly_ridership_df)[
str_detect(names(monthly_ridership_df),
regex("date|month|period", ignore_case = TRUE))
][1]

sub_col_r <- names(monthly_ridership_df)[
str_detect(names(monthly_ridership_df),
regex("subway|subways.*total|ridership", ignore_case = TRUE))
]

to_numeric <- function(x) {
if (is.numeric(x)) as.numeric(x) else readr::parse_number(as.character(x))
}

ridership_month <- monthly_ridership_df |>
mutate(
month = floor_date(
parse_date_time(!!sym(date_col_r),
orders = c("ymd", "mdy", "my")),
"month"
),
subways_total = to_numeric(.data[[sub_col_r[1]]])
) |>
filter(
between(month, start_date, end_date),
!is.na(subways_total)
) |>
group_by(month) |>
summarise(
subways_total = sum(subways_total, na.rm = TRUE),
.groups = "drop"
)
```
### 🔗 Step 7: Merging Crime and Ridership Data & Creating a Normalized Metric

✔ This combines monthly ridership totals with monthly crime counts through the use of a `left_join()`  
✔ Takes out months where any dataset is missing values to keep analytical integrity  
✔ Outputs **crimes per million riders**, a measure (normalized) which accounts for changes in ridership volume
✔ Lets the analysis differentiate amongst changes in *crime totals* as well as changes in *crime risk per rider*  
✔ Outputs a `merged` dataset that is used for visualization and correlation analysis  

➡ The sanity checks in the code below (`summary()` and `head()`) confirm that the dataset that is merged works as expected prior to further analysis.
```{r}
# 7. Merging Crime and Ridership & creating normalized metric
merged <- ridership_month |>
left_join(complaints_transit, by = "month") |>
filter(!is.na(felony_count), !is.na(subways_total)) |>
mutate(
crimes_per_million = 1e6 * felony_count / subways_total
)
# =========================================================
# sanity check
# =========================================================
summary(merged$crimes_per_million)
head(merged)
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Crime per Million Riders

1. Transit crime rates varied from **approximately 4 to 38 crimes per million riders** throughout the period of study.  
2. The years **2015–2017** showcase **higher per-capita crime**. This can be attributed to the fact that ridership was at peak levels whereas crime counts seemed to stay relatively steady.  
3. Following **2018**, per-million crime rates are seen to fall while ridership remains high; crime totals do not increase at the same pace.  
4. The **COVID-19 period** disrupts both ridership and crime. It creates sharp swings in per-capita values which influence later correlation patterns.  

➡ Overall, it can be seen that rider risk decreases prior to COVID, becomes unpredictable during the pandemic, and then stabilizes again once ridership begins recovering.

y = "Transit-Related Complaints (count)"
) +
theme_minimal(base_size = 13)

p_trend
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Smoothed Monthly Crime Trend

- Monthly transit crime showcases **substantial short-term noise**, but the line (LOESS) shows us a much smoother underlying pattern.  
- Crime levels seem to be **relatively high pre-2018**, trend downward slightly, and finally rest around a lower plateau.
- During the **COVID period**, crime counts fall, but not as sharply as ridership, creating an apparent dip followed by a rebound.  
- Following 2022, we can see that the smoothed trend indicates **gradually rising crime counts**. This is consistent with our correlation and risk metrics.  

```{r}

### 📌 Key Indicators for SQ (2015–2025)

- **Total Transit Complaints:** `r sum(merged$felony_count)`  
- **Average Monthly Complaints:** `r round(mean(merged$felony_count), 1)`  
- **Average Crimes per Million Riders:** `r round(mean(merged$crimes_per_million), 2)`  
- **Strongest Crime–Ridership Correlation:** Post-2022 (`r round(cor_post2022, 3)`)  

The metrics above show us a high-level snapshot of how **crime volume** and **crime risk per rider** behave over our study period.
:::

### 🧠 Interpretation: Correlation Between Ridership and Transit Crime

1. The **overall correlation is not too strong (0.29)**; this indicates that ridership and crime share a weak but notable correlation.  
2. **Pre-2022**, the correlation is at the weakest (**0.19**); this suggests that crime levels did not scale in a meaningful manner with changes in ridership.  
3. **Post-2022**, the correlation strengthens substantially and is at its highest point in our study (**0.54**); this indicates a more clear relationship amongst ridership volume and crime counts.  
   - As ridership recovers, **crime counts rise proportionally**.  
   - Transit crime appears **more sensitive to crowding and rider volume** in recent years.  

➡ These results show us that the relationship between ridership and crime is **time-dependent**. The relationship grows stronger in the post-COVID recovery era.

print(p1)
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Scatterplot of Monthly Transit Crimes vs. Ridership

1. The scatter is **widely dispersed**, showing us substantial variation in crime even at similar ridership levels.  
2. The **upward sloping regression line** tells us that higher levels of ridership is only **modestly associated** with higher crime totals.  
3. **COVID-era months** stand out as outliers — there is extremely low ridership but still moderate crime counts — which flattens the overall trend prior to 2022.  
4. These visual patterns align with the correlation results: the ridership–crime relationship becomes **meaningfully stronger only in the later years** of the dataset.  

➡ The scatterplot reiterates the fact that the relationship between crime and ridership is **weak before 2022** and **stronger after ridership recovery begins**.

```{r}

### 🧠 Interpretation: Ridership–Crime Relationship by Period

- In the **Pre-2022** area, we see that the regression line has a small slope, and the cloud of points is more diffused. This implies that ridership and crime are only **weakly correlated**.  
- In the **2022+** area, the slope of the regression line is **clearly steeper**, and points closely align along the trend. This indicates a **stronger ridership–crime connection**.  
- This visual contrast reiterates the numeric results: **correlation roughly triples** from pre-2022 period to post-2022 period.  

➡ TIt can be seen that he relationship between crime and ridership is **structurally different after COVID**. This is an important element in interpreting system-wide trends.

```{r}

)

x = "Month",
y = "Index (Baseline = 100)",
color = NULL
) +
theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
theme(legend.position = "bottom")

print(p2)
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Indexed Trends for Ridership and Transit Crime

**Ridership Index**
1. Shows a **relatively sharp decline during COVID (2020)** as usage was close to completely collapsed.  
2. We see some **gradual recovery** in the following years.  
3. Still remains **below pre-2018 levels**. This indicates an incomplete ridership rebound.

**Crime Index**
- Remains **relatively stable from 2015–2019**, even through fluctuations in ridership.  
- In 2020,  
  1. **Ridership collapses**, but  
  2. Crime collapses **far less proportionally**, leading to **higher per-rider crime risk** despite less number of total incidents.

**Post-2022**
- Both indices begin to **rise closely together**, creating a **stronger correlation** which is observed during the later period.

➡ This trend suggests that the crime–ridership relationship tightened after the pandemic with crime levels

x = "Month",
y = "Crimes per Million Riders"
) +
theme_minimal(base_size = 13)

print(p3)
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Crimes per Million Riders (Normalized Crime Risk)

- **Pre-2018:** Crime-per-capita is quite high; it averaged **30–35 crimes per million riders**.  
- **2018–2019:** Crime-per-capita drops sharply whilst ridership hits peak levels and total crime counts remain relatively stable.  
- **2020:** Low ridership during COVID creates an **inflated spike** in crime risk per-rider, although total complaints decline.  
- **2022–2025:** A **steady upward trend** emerges:  
  - Ridership is recovering,  
  - But **complaints are rising faster**,  
  → resulting in **higher normalized crime rates** in recent years.

➡ This normalized metric captures *actual rider risk*, showing that the system may **feel less safe** even if total crime counts do not rise dramatically.

```{r}
#Heatmap of Crimes per Million Riders Over Time
crime_heat <- merged |>
mutate(
year = lubridate::year(month),
month_num = lubridate::month(month)
)

p_heat <- ggplot(crime_heat, aes(x = month_num, y = factor(year), fill = crimes_per_million)) +

y = "Year",
fill = "Crimes per\nMillion"
) +
theme_minimal(base_size = 13)

p_heat
```
### 🧠 Interpretation: Heatmap of Normalized Crime Risk

- **Darker cells** correspond to **higher crimes per million riders**. This makes it easy to spot which periods pose higher levels of risk.  
- The pre-2018 rows demonstrate **consistently darker shading**. This reinforces the idea that earlier years had **higher per-rider risk**.  
- The COVID period appears as an **irregular band**, reflecting disrupted ridership and crime patterns.  
- Recent years (2022–2025) show a **visible darkening trend**, consistent with the upward slope in the crimes-per-million line plot.  

➡ The heatmap provides a compact view of how **risk levels shift across both years and seasons**, complementing the time-series plots.

```
### 🧠 Final Interpretation for SQ: Ridership–Crime Relationship (2015–2025)

- Transit crime and subway ridership show a **modest overall positive correlation** across 2015–2025 (**r ≈ 0.29**).  
- This relationship is **not stable over time**:  
  - **Pre-2022:** Correlation is quite weak, indicating crime levels didn't scale strongly with ridership.  
  - **Post-2022:** Correlation increases significantly (**r ≈ 0.54**); this suggests crime counts now rise more consistently with recovery in ridership.  
- Normalized crime measures (**crimes per million riders**) add more insight:  
  - Per-rider risk **fell sharply in 2018–2019**, whereas ridership peaked and crime counts remained predictable and stable.  
  - Post-COVID levels of risk **rise again** as crime grows at a quicker rate than ridership.  

➡ Overall, more recent years demonstrate a higher correlation between rider volume and crime levels, while normalized metrics highlight that **per-rider risk has increased** despite crime totals not rising dramatically.

::: {.callout-important}
### 🟣 Key Takeaway: Ridership–Crime Dynamics Have Shifted Post-COVID  
- The ridership–crime correlation strengthened substantially after 2022.  
- Rider risk (crimes per million riders) has increased in recent years, even without dramatic increases in total crime.  
- System-level crime trends must be interpreted relative to underlying ridership volume, not in isolation.  
:::

### ⚠️ Limitations

- NYPD complaint data reflects **reported incidents**. This may under-represent actual crime levels and can vary with the nature of reporting.  
- Ridership data is based on **turnstile entries/exits**. This may include noise from repeat taps or non-trip-related swipes. Additionally, there may be riders who didn't tap or swipe their cards.  
- COVID-era months disrupt standard time-series assumptions. This makes trends more harder to estimate.
- Categories of crimes are **aggregated across offense types**; certain categories may show different dynamics when compared to the system-wide pattern.

### 🔮 Future Work

- Improve the analysis to either the **station or line level** in order to identify high-risk routes as well as localized hotspots.  
- Incorporate **lagged relationships** (such as ARIMA and VAR) in order to assess if changes in ridership predict future crime.  
- Add **covariates** such as police deployment or service changes.
- Explore **predictive models** in order to predict months that are high-risk for riders or periods where MTA should focus more on resource allocation and staffing.
